This study is a multicenter research project that provides a noninvasive imaging-based decision-support framework for Crohn’s disease. It integrates habitat radiomics with a multi-view 2.5D Swin Transformer and attention-based feature fusion to assess mucosal healing after biologic therapy and to derive an imaging-based risk index for predicting subsequent disease progression. The project also includes a user-friendly graphical application to facilitate deployment within routine CTE workflows and to support personalized treatment monitoring and clinical decision-making.
